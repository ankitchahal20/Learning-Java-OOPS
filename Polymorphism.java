Poly means many and morphism means form.

There are two types of Polymorphism,
    - compile time polymorphism,
    - runtime polymorphism,

If the selection of one-form amongst the many form is performed at compile-time then there will be compile time
polymorphism such as methodoverloading, operator overloading.

If the selection of one-form amongst the many form is performed at run-time then there will be run time
polymorphism.
